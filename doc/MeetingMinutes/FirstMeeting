We should meet once a week during the labs.

Pair programming so that each pair can have continuous progress if one of the two gets busy.

Project Tab (list tasks to finish and how they are progressing or finished) and Wiki Tab (project objective, docs) should be used to track our work.
He'll share a Git repo from last year.

Create a new branch for a new part of the application. Once that branch is successfully implemented, then merge it, but don't work on the master branch all the time.

Each pair is evaluated separately and we can reach out to him all the time for feedback on our sections.

Pair 1 - Kyle & Marcus (Deliverable 3)
Pair 2 - Marty & Kourosh (Deliverable 2)
Pair 3 - Ragur & Simon (Deliverable 1)
