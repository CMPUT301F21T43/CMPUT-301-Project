General Notes
=========================
- Marty added unique icon for friends in navbar.
- Marty changed Firebase rules back to read and write for everyone. 
- Marty fixed the DateToStart functionality to be EditText based.
- #53 is being worked on. So far it's been fixed when coming from Add or Edit Habit. Now only appears when first entering app.
- Ragur finished map and geolocation. Just needs to push it. Having an issue where optional photo inside Events is small. 
- Ragur is adding checkboxes for habit events list and can't click the checkbox without clicking on the list items.
- Working on receiving notifications and accepting/denying friend requests. Following is working. Unfollowing has two options: 
  (1) Follow button changes to unfollow immediately and can unfollow then. 
  (2) After following, person disappears and have to go to friends list to unfollow them.
 Going with option 2.
 - Simon is working on prog bar and been debugging.
 - Kyle submitted a PR.
 



 
Bugs
=========================
- Signing in the first time on app startup doesn't load data to Habit List. When clicking around then returning to the screen, it loads.
