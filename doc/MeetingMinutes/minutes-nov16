Sakib's Notes on our demo: We should approach the demo as selling our product to customers. Presentation has to be attractive so that people are interested in using it. Be sure to include every aspect of the project in the demo. Include all team members when presenting. Try to make it audience centric, try to convince the people that they want to use this product.
