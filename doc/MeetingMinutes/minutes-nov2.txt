Meeting Minutes for November 2


Attendence: 

Observations from A2
=========================
 - Whatever we design in CRC cards or UML diagram should align with our implementation. Activities and Fragments are not required.
 - Problem was with Object Oriented analysis where many requirements were missed. Otherwise most else was good.
 
General Notes
=========================
 - Robotium doesn't integrate with Firestore for intent testing, but Espresso does so try that.
 - Need to do demonstration week after reading week
 
 Work to do
